## 🤓 Project Overview ##
* Describe your project. What is it called? What does it do? Why did you make this web application? Who will benefit from using your web application? Describe your users - who are they? (anyone? or specific target age group or gender? region? country?)
* Feel free to use diagrams and images to describe. For example, if you have a system architecture diagram, please place it here and describe it. If you have a business process diagram, you can also place it here and describe it.

DeliveryHeroes is a web application built to serve all food delivery riders in Singapore. Ever since COVID-19 started, there has been a surge in demand for food deliveries due to the strict dine-in restrictions, and thus also a derived increase in demand for food delivery riders. 
As such, there has been an increase in the number of reports of abuse from customers towards these unsung heroes. However, there are also reports of various acts of kindness by the general pubic towards these delivery riders, such as setting up rest stops in various community locations for riders to take a breather. As such, our team thought that creating this web application would serve as a platform to aid these delivery riders in their work. 

The DeliveryHeroes platform will allow food delivery riders to check on available carpark lots based on their current location, or searching for the address through the search bar. They are also able to check for live 2-hour updates on the weather based on the selected location in order to prepare for their journey ahead in case of wet weather. Finally, they are also able to search for rest-stops based on their current location or an inputted location, and filter out these rest stops based on the amenities offered in these rest stops.

For the general public, they are also able to use this DeliveryHeroes platform to share encouraging messages and stories in their interactions with delivery riders, and keep their morale high. Furthermore, those that would like to contribute in creating a rest stop
can create new rest stops to feature them on our platform for delivery riders to use.
